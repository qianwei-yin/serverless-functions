### What is Serverless Apps?

Serverless is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers.

There **are still servers** in serverless, but they are abstracted away from app development. A cloud provider handles the routine work of provisioning, maintaining, and scaling the server infrastructure. Developers can simply package their code in containers for deployment.
